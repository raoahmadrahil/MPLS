# MPLS
• Created a topology with OSPF as the base protocol where there are multiple ways to reach endpoints.
• Enabled MPLS and traffic-engineering on routers (globally), router's interfaces and OSPF areas.
• Reserved bandwidth for tunnels on router's interfaces.
• Configured and defined tunnel path along with the autoroute command.
• Enabled fast reroute and bw-protect on tunnels.
• Configured the backup tunnels with an additional exclude-address command.
• Shutting down different links to monitor how backup tunnel works with changing labels.
